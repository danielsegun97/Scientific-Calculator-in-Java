# Scientific-Calculator-in-Java
Java Scientific Calculator Project

We completed this project as part of a set of three projects required for a data structures course in spring 2020.

In groups of 2 to 4 students, you will implement one large program or 2 to 3 smaller programs of your
choice, using all of the topics below. This is a collaborative project, so make sure you are working as a
team. It may take some time to develop a program topic or topics, that satisfy the final project
requirements. All groups and topics of the project elements need to be approved by the instructor. Your
project should also have a real world component if possible. For example, you could create a scheduling
program that makes use of a doubly linked list; a mock package delivery tracking system that uses priority
queues; a program that can determine if a graph is two colorable for any given graph, etc. You can use
some of the programming practice samples from the end of the chapters to get an idea.
All groups will present their projects on the last day of class.
You will need to submit through blackboard the following:
1. All associated project code with contacting all group membersâ€™ names. Your code needs to be well
documented and organized.
2. A detailed description of your project and how each component works. Be sure to discuss any difficulties
your team encountered developing the project. This should be a minimum of 2 pages and included an
analysis using Big-O notation.
3. A presentation file. For the presentation day, your group will have 10 minutes to explain to the class
what your program does, all components and difficulties faced.
Your program must contain all the following elements:
1. Use of at least three Abstract Data Types
2. Use of inheritance and polymorphism
3. Use of recursion
4. Connection and use of a simple database
5. At least one sorting algorithm
6. At least one search algorithm
7. Use of a graphical user interface
Additional Grading Criteria (See Rubric):
1. Accuracy
2. Completeness
3. Creativity
4. Group Cooperation
5. Detail and Documentation
6. Correct use of major topics
